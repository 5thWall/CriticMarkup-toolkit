You can put this set of BBEdit clippings in the `Clippings/Markdown.markdown` folder of your BBEdit configuration folder (`~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings/Markdown.markdown` unless you've moved your configuration directory to Dropbox).

1. Put them in the appropriate folder
2. Start BBEdit
3. Use the clippings menu:
  - For the substitution, deletion or highlight marks, select some text then double-click the appropriate clipping in the Markdown clippings palette.
  - For the insertion or comment marks, place the cursor at the appropriate place in the text and click the appropriate clipping in the Markdown clippings palette.

You can also assign keyboard shortcuts to each of the clippings from the clippings palette. The "control" combinations are largely unused in BBEdit (with the exception of control-s, which is used for progressive search).

Finally, you can make the clippings appear at the top of the Clippings palette by appending `00)` the beginning of the filename for each.
